# 🔍 Transaction Status Check

## Your Recent Transactions

I can see you've made **7 stream-to transactions**. Let's check which ones succeeded:

### Transaction IDs (from your history):
1. `fb756a2a8023a7118e8fc225bef6123337a9c854bffd4f6fc180b659ea05deff` - Fee: 319568 µSTX (15 min ago)
2. `d3a368a...` (partial) - Fee: 189137 µSTX (18 min ago) 
3. `37df4bc5e00a3d665782f4206630973cb6a077d09843a1ddd1e8e5409e518b51` - Fee: 3000 µSTX (38 min ago)
4. `92bcfd4...` (partial) - Fee: 3400 µSTX (41 min ago)

6. `eb1d21691359e591862a51a6bed241820874412e9760a9d047c08bd9d02db58c` - Fee: 3000 µSTX (1 hour ago)
7. `667ebb5...` (partial) - Fee: 7555 µSTX (2 hours ago)

## ⚠️ Total Fees Paid
**~529,260 µSTX = ~0.53 STX** (about $0.53 USD)

## ✅ How to Check Transaction Status

### Method 1: Check Each Transaction
Visit each transaction on the explorer:
- https://explorer.stacks.co/txid/{TX_ID}?chain=testnet

Replace `{TX_ID}` with the full transaction ID.

### Method 2: Check Your Address
1. Go to: https://explorer.stacks.co/address/STFMR5YYDP5P4X3FD9Y1D3SK87X8W5J191H71T7S?chain=testnet
2. Click on each transaction
3. Look for:
   - ✅ **Success** = Stream was created
   - ❌ **Failed** = No stream, but fee was paid

## 🔧 Why Streams Might Not Show

1. **Transactions Failed**: If transactions failed due to post-condition errors, no streams were created
2. **Wrong Contract**: The deployed contract might be different from what the app expects
3. **Sequential Loading Issue**: The app stops after 5 consecutive failures - I've increased this to 20

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Check which transactions succeeded** using the explorer links above
2. **Refresh your app** - I've increased the stream search limit
3. **Try creating a new stream** - The latest fix should prevent failures

## 📊 What We Know

- **Contract Address**: `ST3DJAD94M03E59W51PWD3VT0XH3S8VXZPXT59P5G.stream`
- **Your Address**: `STFMR5YYDP5P4X3FD9Y1D3SK87X8W5J191H71T7S`
- **Total Attempts**: 7 transactions
- **Total Fees**: ~0.53 STX

The app will now:
- ✅ Check transaction status automatically
- ✅ Search for more streams (up to 20 IDs)
- ✅ Show clearer error messages
