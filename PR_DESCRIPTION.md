- **Pause Block Tracking**: Accurately tracks paused periods
- **Balance Calculation**: Updated to account for paused periods
- **Error Handling**: New error codes for pause/resume scenarios

### 2. Modern React Frontend (`react-frontend/`)

### 3. Enhanced Testing (`tests/stream.test.ts`)

Added comprehensive test suite for pause/resume functionality:

- ✅ Pause an active stream
- ✅ Prevent pause from non-sender
- ✅ Resume a paused stream
- ✅ Verify tokens don't accumulate while paused
